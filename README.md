I have in this file amended the original code in attempt for the website to meet accessibility standards. 



This has been done by;

- That I have changed div elements to semantic HTML elements such as; header, section, aside, footer etc.
- The structure of the elements follows a logical structure of how they are to be viewed on the website.
- The alt attributes of the ‘img’ element is descriptive of what the image displays.
- The heading elements is placed in a sequential order by how the website is viewed.
- The title element has been altered to be more descriptive to the organisation.
